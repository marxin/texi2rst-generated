OpenMP Runtime Library Routines
-------------------------------

The runtime routines described here are defined by Section 3 of the OpenMP
specification in version 4.5.  The routines are structured in following
three parts:

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2

  Control threads, processors and the parallel environment.  They have C
  linkage, and do not throw exceptions.


  Initialize, set, test, unset and destroy simple and nested locks.


  Portable, thread-based, wall clock timer.


  Support for event objects.
