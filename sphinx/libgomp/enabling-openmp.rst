Enabling OpenMP
---------------

To activate the OpenMP extensions for C/C++ and Fortran, the compile-time 
flag :command:`-fopenmp` must be specified.  This enables the OpenMP directive
``#pragma omp`` in C/C++ and ``!$omp`` directives in free form, 
``c$omp``, ``*$omp`` and ``!$omp`` directives in fixed form, 
``!$`` conditional compilation sentinels in free form and ``c$``,
``*$`` and ``!$`` sentinels in fixed form, for Fortran.  The flag also
arranges for automatic linking of the OpenMP runtime library 
(Runtime Library Routines).

A complete description of all OpenMP directives may be found in the
`OpenMP Application Program Interface <https://www.openmp.org>`_ manuals.
