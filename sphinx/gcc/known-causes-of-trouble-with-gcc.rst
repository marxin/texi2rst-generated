Known Causes of Trouble with GCC
--------------------------------

.. index:: bugs, known

.. index:: installation trouble

.. index:: known causes of trouble

This section describes known problems that affect users of GCC.  Most
of these are not GCC bugs per se-if they were, we would fix them.
But the result for a user may be like the result of a bug.

Some of these problems are due to bugs in other software, some are
missing features that are too much work to add, and some are places
where people's opinions differ as to what is best.
