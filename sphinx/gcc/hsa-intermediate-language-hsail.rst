HSA Intermediate Language (HSAIL)
*********************************

GCC can compile the binary representation (BRIG) of the HSAIL text format as
described in HSA Programmer's Reference Manual version 1.0.1. This
capability is typically utilized to implement the HSA runtime API's HSAIL 
finalization extension for a gcc supported processor. HSA standards are
freely available at http://www.hsafoundation.com/standards/.
