TILE-Gx Built-in Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GCC provides intrinsics to access every instruction of the TILE-Gx
processor.  The intrinsics are of the form:

.. code-block:: c++

  unsigned long long __insn_op (...)

Where :samp:`{op}` is the name of the instruction.  Refer to the ISA manual
for the complete list of instructions.

GCC also provides intrinsics to directly access the network registers.
The intrinsics are:

.. code-block:: c++

  unsigned long long __tile_idn0_receive (void);
  unsigned long long __tile_idn1_receive (void);
  unsigned long long __tile_udn0_receive (void);
  unsigned long long __tile_udn1_receive (void);
  unsigned long long __tile_udn2_receive (void);
  unsigned long long __tile_udn3_receive (void);
  void __tile_idn_send (unsigned long long);
  void __tile_udn_send (unsigned long long);

The intrinsic ``void __tile_network_barrier (void)`` is used to
guarantee that no network operations before it are reordered with
those after it.
