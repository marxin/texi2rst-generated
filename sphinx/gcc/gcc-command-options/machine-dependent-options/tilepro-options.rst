TILEPro Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: TILEPro options

These :samp:`-m` options are supported on the TILEPro:

.. option:: -mcpu={name}

  Selects the type of CPU to be targeted.  Currently the only supported
  type is :samp:`tilepro`.

.. option:: -m32

  Generate code for a 32-bit environment, which sets int, long, and
  pointer to 32 bits.  This is the only supported behavior so the flag
  is essentially ignored.
