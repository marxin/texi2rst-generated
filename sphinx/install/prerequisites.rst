GCC requires that various tools and packages be available for use in the
build procedure.  Modifying GCC sources requires additional tools
described below.

Tools/packages necessary for building GCC
=========================================

ISO C++11 compiler
  Necessary to bootstrap GCC.

  Versions of GCC prior to 11 also allow bootstrapping with an ISO C++98
  compiler, versions of GCC prior to 4.8 also allow bootstrapping with a
  ISO C89 compiler, and versions of GCC prior to 3.4 also allow
  bootstrapping with a traditional (K&R) C compiler.

  To build all languages in a cross-compiler or other configuration where
  3-stage bootstrap is not performed, you need to start with an existing
  GCC binary (version 4.8 or later) because source code for language
  frontends other than C might use GCC extensions.

  Note that to bootstrap GCC with versions of GCC earlier than 4.8, you
  may need to use :option:`--disable-stage1-checking`, though
  bootstrapping the compiler with such earlier compilers is strongly
  discouraged.

C standard library and headers
  In order to build GCC, the C standard library and headers must be present
  for all target variants for which target libraries will be built (and not
  only the variant of the host C++ compiler).

  This affects the popular :samp:`x86_64-pc-linux-gnu` platform (among
  other multilib targets), for which 64-bit (:samp:`x86_64`) and 32-bit
  (:samp:`i386`) libc headers are usually packaged separately. If you do a
  build of a native compiler on :samp:`x86_64-pc-linux-gnu`, make sure you
  either have the 32-bit libc developer package properly installed (the exact
  name of the package depends on your distro) or you must build GCC as a
  64-bit only compiler by configuring with the option
  :option:`--disable-multilib`.  Otherwise, you may encounter an error such as
  :samp:`fatal error: gnu/stubs-32.h: No such file`

.. envvar:: GNAT

  .. _gnat-prerequisite:
  In order to build GNAT, the Ada compiler, you need a working GNAT
  compiler (GCC version 4.7 or later).

  This includes GNAT tools such as :command:`gnatmake` and
  :command:`gnatlink`, since the Ada front end is written in Ada and
  uses some GNAT-specific extensions.

  In order to build a cross compiler, it is strongly recommended to install
  the new compiler as native first, and then use it to build the cross
  compiler. Other native compiler versions may work but this is not guaranteed and
  will typically fail with hard to understand compilation errors during the
  build.

  Similarly, it is strongly recommended to use an older version of GNAT to build
  GNAT. More recent versions of GNAT than the version built are not guaranteed
  to work and will often fail during the build with compilation errors.

  Note that :command:`configure` does not test whether the GNAT installation works
  and has a sufficiently recent version; if too old a GNAT version is
  installed and :option:`--enable-languages`:samp:`=ada` is used, the build will fail.

  :envvar:`ADA_INCLUDE_PATH` and :envvar:`ADA_OBJECT_PATH` environment variables
  must not be set when building the Ada compiler, the Ada tools, or the
  Ada runtime libraries. You can check that your build environment is clean
  by verifying that :samp:`gnatls -v` lists only one explicit path in each
  section.

A 'working' POSIX compatible shell, or GNU bash
  Necessary when running :command:`configure` because some
  :command:`/bin/sh` shells have bugs and may crash when configuring the
  target libraries.  In other cases, :command:`/bin/sh` or :command:`ksh`
  have disastrous corner-case performance problems.  This
  can cause target :command:`configure` runs to literally take days to
  complete in some cases.

  So on some platforms :command:`/bin/ksh` is sufficient, on others it
  isn't.  See the host/target specific instructions for your platform, or
  use :command:`bash` to be sure.  Then set :envvar:`CONFIG_SHELL` in your
  environment to your 'good' shell prior to running
  :command:`configure`/:command:`make`.

  :command:`zsh` is not a fully compliant POSIX shell and will not
  work when configuring GCC.

A POSIX or SVR4 awk
  Necessary for creating some of the generated source files for GCC.
  If in doubt, use a recent GNU awk version, as some of the older ones
  are broken.  GNU awk version 3.1.5 is known to work.

GNU binutils
  Necessary in some circumstances, optional in others.  See the
  host/target specific instructions for your platform for the exact
  requirements.

gzip version 1.2.4 (or later) or bzip2 version 1.0.2 (or later)
  Necessary to uncompress GCC :command:`tar` files when source code is
  obtained via HTTPS mirror sites.

GNU make version 3.80 (or later)
  You must have GNU make installed to build GCC.

GNU tar version 1.14 (or later)
  Necessary (only on some platforms) to untar the source code.  Many
  systems' :command:`tar` programs will also work, only try GNU
  :command:`tar` if you have problems.

Perl version between 5.6.1 and 5.6.24
  Necessary when targeting Darwin, building :samp:`libstdc++`,
  and not using :option:`--disable-symvers`.
  Necessary when targeting Solaris 2 with Solaris :command:`ld` and not using
  :option:`--disable-symvers`.

  Necessary when regenerating Makefile dependencies in libiberty.
  Necessary when regenerating libiberty/functions.texi.
  Necessary when generating manpages from Texinfo manuals.
  Used by various scripts to generate some files included in the source
  repository (mainly Unicode-related and rarely changing) from source
  tables.

  Used by :command:`automake`.

  Several support libraries are necessary to build GCC, some are required,
others optional.  While any sufficiently new version of required tools
usually work, library requirements are generally stricter.  Newer
versions may work in some cases, but it's safer to use the exact
versions documented.  We appreciate bug reports about problems with
newer versions, though.  If your OS vendor provides packages for the
support libraries then using those packages may be the simplest way to
install the libraries.

GNU Multiple Precision Library (GMP) version 4.3.2 (or later)
  Necessary to build GCC.  If a GMP source distribution is found in a
  subdirectory of your GCC sources named gmp, it will be built
  together with GCC.  Alternatively, if GMP is already installed but it
  is not in your library search path, you will have to configure with the
  :option:`--with-gmp` configure option.  See also :option:`--with-gmp-lib`
  and :option:`--with-gmp-include`.
  The in-tree build is only supported with the GMP version that
  download_prerequisites installs.

MPFR Library version 3.1.0 (or later)
  Necessary to build GCC.  It can be downloaded from
  https://www.mpfr.org.  If an MPFR source distribution is found
  in a subdirectory of your GCC sources named mpfr, it will be
  built together with GCC.  Alternatively, if MPFR is already installed
  but it is not in your default library search path, the
  :option:`--with-mpfr` configure option should be used.  See also
  :option:`--with-mpfr-lib` and :option:`--with-mpfr-include`.
  The in-tree build is only supported with the MPFR version that
  download_prerequisites installs.

MPC Library version 1.0.1 (or later)
  Necessary to build GCC.  It can be downloaded from
  http://www.multiprecision.org/mpc/.  If an MPC source distribution
  is found in a subdirectory of your GCC sources named mpc, it
  will be built together with GCC.  Alternatively, if MPC is already
  installed but it is not in your default library search path, the
  :option:`--with-mpc` configure option should be used.  See also
  :option:`--with-mpc-lib` and :option:`--with-mpc-include`.
  The in-tree build is only supported with the MPC version that
  download_prerequisites installs.

isl Library version 0.15 or later.
  Necessary to build GCC with the Graphite loop optimizations.
  It can be downloaded from https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/.
  If an isl source distribution is found
  in a subdirectory of your GCC sources named isl, it will be
  built together with GCC.  Alternatively, the :option:`--with-isl` configure
  option should be used if isl is not installed in your default library
  search path.

zstd Library.
  Necessary to build GCC with zstd compression used for LTO bytecode.
  The library is searched in your default library patch search.
  Alternatively, the :option:`--with-zstd` configure option should be used.

Tools/packages necessary for modifying GCC
==========================================

autoconf version 2.69 GNU m4 version 1.4.6 (or later)
  Necessary when modifying configure.ac, aclocal.m4, etc.
  to regenerate configure and config.in files.

automake version 1.15.1
  Necessary when modifying a Makefile.am file to regenerate its
  associated Makefile.in.

  Much of GCC does not use automake, so directly edit the Makefile.in
  file.  Specifically this applies to the gcc, intl,
  libcpp, libiberty, libobjc directories as well
  as any of their subdirectories.

  For directories that use automake, GCC requires the latest release in
  the 1.15 series, which is currently 1.15.1.  When regenerating a directory
  to a newer version, please update all the directories using an older 1.15
  to the latest released version.

gettext version 0.14.5 (or later)
  Needed to regenerate gcc.pot.

gperf version 2.7.2 (or later)
  Necessary when modifying :command:`gperf` input files, e.g.
  gcc/cp/cfns.gperf to regenerate its associated header file, e.g.
  gcc/cp/cfns.h.

DejaGnu 1.4.4 Expect Tcl

  .. Once Tcl 8.5 or higher is required, remove any obsolete
     compatibility workarounds:
         git grep 'compatibility with earlier Tcl releases'

  Necessary to run the GCC testsuite; see the section on testing for
  details.

autogen version 5.5.4 (or later) and guile version 1.4.1 (or later)
  Necessary to regenerate fixinc/fixincl.x from
  fixinc/inclhack.def and fixinc/*.tpl.

  Necessary to run :samp:`make check` for fixinc.

  Necessary to regenerate the top level Makefile.in file from
  Makefile.tpl and Makefile.def.

Flex version 2.5.4 (or later)
  Necessary when modifying *.l files.

  Necessary to build GCC during development because the generated output
  files are not included in the version-controlled source repository.
  They are included in releases.

Texinfo version 4.7 (or later)
  Necessary for running :command:`makeinfo` when modifying *.texi
  files to test your changes.

  Necessary for running :command:`make dvi` or :command:`make pdf` to
  create printable documentation in DVI or PDF format.  Texinfo version
  4.8 or later is required for :command:`make pdf`.

  Necessary to build GCC documentation during development because the
  generated output files are not included in the repository.  They are
  included in releases.

Tex (any working version)
  Necessary for running :command:`texi2dvi` and :command:`texi2pdf`, which
  are used when running :command:`make dvi` or :command:`make pdf` to create
  DVI or PDF files, respectively.

Sphinx version 1.0 (or later)
  Necessary to regenerate jit/docs/_build/texinfo from the .rst
  files in the directories below jit/docs.

git (any version) SSH (any version)
  Necessary to access the source repository.  Public releases and weekly
  snapshots of the development sources are also available via HTTPS.

GNU diffutils version 2.7 (or later)
  Useful when submitting patches for the GCC source code.
