We are often asked about pre-compiled versions of GCC.  While we cannot
provide these for all platforms, below you'll find links to binaries for
various platforms where creating them by yourself is not easy due to various
reasons.

Please note that we did not create these binaries, nor do we
support them.  If you have any problems installing them, please
contact their makers.
