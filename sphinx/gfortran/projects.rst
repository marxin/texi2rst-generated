*Help build the test suite*
  Solicit more code for donation to the test suite: the more extensive the
  testsuite, the smaller the risk of breaking things in the future! We can
  keep code private on request.

*Bug hunting/squishing*
  Find bugs and write more test cases! Test cases are especially very
  welcome, because it allows us to concentrate on fixing bugs instead of
  isolating them.  Going through the bugzilla database at
  https://gcc.gnu.org//bugzilla/ to reduce testcases posted there and
  add more information (for example, for which version does the testcase
  work, for which versions does it fail?) is also very helpful.
