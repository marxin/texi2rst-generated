.. _link-options:

Influencing the linking step
****************************

These options come into play when the compiler links object files into an 
executable output file. They are meaningless if the compiler is not doing 
a link step.

.. index:: static-libgfortran

.. option:: -static-libgfortran

  On systems that provide :samp:`libgfortran` as a shared and a static
  library, this option forces the use of the static version. If no
  shared version of :samp:`libgfortran` was built when the compiler was
  configured, this option has no effect.
