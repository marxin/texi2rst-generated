The GNU Fortran compiler is the successor to :command:`g77`, the Fortran
77 front end included in GCC prior to version 4.  It is an entirely new
program that has been designed to provide Fortran 95 support and
extensibility for future Fortran language standards, as well as providing
backwards compatibility for Fortran 77 and nearly all of the GNU language
extensions supported by :command:`g77`.
