Option Index
============

:command:`gfortran`'s command line options are indexed here without any
initial :samp:`-` or :samp:`--`.  Where an option has both positive and
negative forms (such as -foption and -fno-option), relevant entries in
the manual are indexed under the most appropriate form; it may sometimes
be useful to look up both forms.
