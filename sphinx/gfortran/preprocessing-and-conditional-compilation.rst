Many Fortran compilers including GNU Fortran allow passing the source code
through a C preprocessor (CPP; sometimes also called the Fortran preprocessor,
FPP) to allow for conditional compilation.  In the case of GNU Fortran,
this is the GNU C Preprocessor in the traditional mode.  On systems with
case-preserving file names, the preprocessor is automatically invoked if the
filename extension is .F, .FOR, .FTN, .fpp,
.FPP, .F90, .F95, .F03 or .F08.  To manually
invoke the preprocessor on any file, use :option:`-cpp` , to disable
preprocessing on files where the preprocessor is run automatically, use
:option:`-nocpp`.

If a preprocessed file includes another file with the Fortran ``INCLUDE``
statement, the included file is not preprocessed.  To preprocess included
files, use the equivalent preprocessor statement ``#include``.

If GNU Fortran invokes the preprocessor, ``__GFORTRAN__``
is defined.  The macros ``__GNUC__``, ``__GNUC_MINOR__`` and
``__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__`` can be used to determine the version of the
compiler.  See TopOverviewcppThe C Preprocessor for details.

GNU Fortran supports a number of ``INTEGER`` and ``REAL`` kind types
in additional to the kind types required by the Fortran standard.
The availability of any given kind type is architecture dependent.  The
following pre-defined preprocessor macros can be used to conditionally
include code for these additional kind types: ``__GFC_INT_1__``,
``__GFC_INT_2__``, ``__GFC_INT_8__``, ``__GFC_INT_16__``,
``__GFC_REAL_10__``, and ``__GFC_REAL_16__``.

While CPP is the de-facto standard for preprocessing Fortran code,
Part 3 of the Fortran 95 standard (ISO/IEC 1539-3:1998) defines
Conditional Compilation, which is not widely used and not directly
supported by the GNU Fortran compiler.  You can use the program coco
to preprocess such files (http://www.daniellnagle.com/coco.html).
