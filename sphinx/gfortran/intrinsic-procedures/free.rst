.. function:: FREE(PTR)

  Frees memory previously allocated by ``MALLOC``. The ``FREE``
  intrinsic is an extension intended to be used with Cray pointers, and is
  provided in GNU Fortran to allow user to compile legacy code. For
  new code using Fortran 95 pointers, the memory de-allocation intrinsic is
  ``DEALLOCATE``.

  :param PTR:
    The type shall be ``INTEGER``. It represents the
    location of the memory that should be de-allocated.

    None
