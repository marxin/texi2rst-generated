SHIFTA --- Right shift with fill
********************************

.. index:: SHIFTA

.. index:: bits, shift right

.. index:: shift, right with fill

.. function:: SHIFTA

  ``SHIFTA`` returns a value corresponding to :samp:`{I}` with all of the
  bits shifted right by :samp:`{SHIFT}` places.  :samp:`{SHIFT}` that be
  nonnegative and less than or equal to ``BIT_SIZE(I)``, otherwise
  the result value is undefined.  Bits shifted out from the right end
  are lost. The fill is arithmetic: the bits shifted in from the left
  end are equal to the leftmost bit, which in two's complement
  representation is the sign bit.

  :param I:
    The type shall be ``INTEGER``.

  :param SHIFT:
    The type shall be ``INTEGER``.

  :return:
    The return value is of type ``INTEGER`` and of the same kind as
    :samp:`{I}`.

  :samp:`{Standard}:`
    Fortran 2008 and later

  :samp:`{Class}:`
    Elemental function

  :samp:`{Syntax}:`

  .. code-block:: fortran

    RESULT = SHIFTA(I, SHIFT)
