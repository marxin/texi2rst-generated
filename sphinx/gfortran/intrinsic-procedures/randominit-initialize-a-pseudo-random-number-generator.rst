RANDOM_INIT --- Initialize a pseudo-random number generator
***********************************************************

.. index:: RANDOM_INIT

.. index:: random number generation, initialization

.. function:: RANDOM_INIT

  Initializes the state of the pseudorandom number generator used by 
  ``RANDOM_NUMBER``.

  :param REPEATABLE:
    Shall be a scalar with a ``LOGICAL`` type,
    and it is ``INTENT(IN)``.  If it is ``.true.``, the seed is set to
    a processor-dependent value that is the same each time ``RANDOM_INIT``
    is called from the same image.  The term 'same image' means a single
    instance of program execution.  The sequence of random numbers is different
    for repeated execution of the program.  If it is ``.false.``, the seed
    is set to a processor-dependent value.

  :param IMAGE_DISTINCT:
    Shall be a scalar with a
    ``LOGICAL`` type, and it is ``INTENT(IN)``.  If it is ``.true.``,
    the seed is set to a processor-dependent value that is distinct from th
    seed set by a call to ``RANDOM_INIT`` in another image.  If it is
    ``.false.``, the seed is set to a value that does depend which image called
    ``RANDOM_INIT``.
