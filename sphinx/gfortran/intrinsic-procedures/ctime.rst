CTIME --- Convert a time into a string
**************************************

.. index:: CTIME

.. index:: time, conversion to string

.. index:: conversion, to string

.. function:: CTIME

  ``CTIME`` converts a system time value, such as returned by
  TIME8, to a string. The output will be of the form :samp:`Sat
  Aug 19 18:13:14 1995`.

  :param TIME:
    The type shall be of type ``INTEGER``.

  :param RESULT:
    The type shall be of type ``CHARACTER`` and
    of default kind. It is an ``INTENT(OUT)`` argument. If the length
    of this variable is too short for the time and date string to fit
    completely, it will be blank on procedure return.

  :return:
    The converted date and time as a string.

      program test_ctime
          integer(8) :: i

          i = time8()

          ! Do something, main part of the program
