SYSTEM_CLOCK --- Time function
******************************

.. index:: SYSTEM_CLOCK

.. index:: time, clock ticks

.. index:: clock ticks

.. function:: SYSTEM_CLOCK(COUNT, COUNT_RATE, COUNT_MAX)

  Determines the :samp:`{COUNT}` of a processor clock since an unspecified
  time in the past modulo :samp:`{COUNT_MAX}`, :samp:`{COUNT_RATE}` determines
  the number of clock ticks per second.  If the platform supports a
  monotonic clock, that clock is used and can, depending on the platform
  clock implementation, provide up to nanosecond resolution.  If a
  monotonic clock is not available, the implementation falls back to a
  realtime clock.

  :param COUNT:
    (Optional) shall be a scalar of type 
    ``INTEGER`` with ``INTENT(OUT)``.

  :param COUNT_RATE:
    (Optional) shall be a scalar of type 
    ``INTEGER`` or ``REAL``, with ``INTENT(OUT)``.

  :param COUNT_MAX:
    (Optional) shall be a scalar of type 
    ``INTEGER`` with ``INTENT(OUT)``.

  :samp:`{Standard}:`
    Fortran 90 and later

  :samp:`{Class}:`

  :samp:`{Syntax}:`
