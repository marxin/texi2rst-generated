NEAREST --- Nearest representable number
****************************************

.. function:: NEAREST(X, S)

  ``NEAREST(X, S)`` returns the processor-representable number nearest
  to ``X`` in the direction indicated by the sign of ``S``.

  :param X:
    Shall be of type ``REAL``.

  :param S:
    Shall be of type ``REAL`` and
    not equal to zero.

  :return:
    The return value is of the same type as ``X``. If ``S`` is
    positive, ``NEAREST`` returns the processor-representable number
    greater than ``X`` and nearest to it. If ``S`` is negative,
    ``NEAREST`` returns the processor-representable number smaller than
    ``X`` and nearest to it.
