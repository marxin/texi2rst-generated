UNPACK --- Unpack an array of rank one into an array
****************************************************

.. index:: UNPACK

.. index:: array, unpacking

.. index:: array, increase dimension

.. index:: array, scatter elements

.. function:: UNPACK(VECTOR, MASK, FIELD)

  Store the elements of :samp:`{VECTOR}` in an array of higher rank.

  :param VECTOR:
    Shall be an array of any type and rank one. It 
    shall have at least as many elements as :samp:`{MASK}` has ``TRUE`` values.

  :param MASK:
    Shall be an array of type ``LOGICAL``.

  :param FIELD:
    Shall be of the same type as :samp:`{VECTOR}` and have
    the same shape as :samp:`{MASK}`.

  :return:
    The resulting array corresponds to :samp:`{FIELD}` with ``TRUE`` elements
    of :samp:`{MASK}` replaced by values from :samp:`{VECTOR}` in array element order.

  :samp:`{Standard}:`
    Fortran 90 and later

  :samp:`{Class}:`
    Transformational function

  :samp:`{Syntax}:`

    .. code-block:: fortran

      RESULT = UNPACK(VECTOR, MASK, FIELD)

  :samp:`{Example}:`

    .. code-block:: fortran

      PROGRAM test_unpack
        integer :: vector(2)  = (/1,1/)
        logical :: mask(4)  = (/ .TRUE., .FALSE., .FALSE., .TRUE. /)
        integer :: field(2,2) = 0, unity(2,2)

        ! result: unity matrix
        unity = unpack(vector, reshape(mask, (/2,2/)), field)
      END PROGRAM
