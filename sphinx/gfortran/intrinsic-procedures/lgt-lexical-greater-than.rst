LGT --- Lexical greater than
****************************

.. index:: LGT

.. index:: lexical comparison of strings

.. index:: string, comparison

.. function:: LGT

  Determines whether one string is lexically greater than another string,
  where the two strings are interpreted as containing ASCII character
  codes.  If the String A and String B are not the same length, the
  shorter is compared as if spaces were appended to it to form a value
  that has the same length as the longer.

  :param STRING_A:
    Shall be of default ``CHARACTER`` type.

  :param STRING_B:
    Shall be of default ``CHARACTER`` type.

  :return:
    Returns ``.TRUE.`` if ``STRING_A > STRING_B``, and ``.FALSE.``
    otherwise, based on the ASCII ordering.
