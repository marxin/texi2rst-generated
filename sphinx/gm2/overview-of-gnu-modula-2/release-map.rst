Release map
***********

GNU Modula-2 is now part of GCC and therefore will adopt the GCC
release schedule with a git branches matching the various GCC release
numbers.  It is intended that GNU Modula-2 implement more of the GCC
builtins (vararg access) and GCC features.

There is an intention to implement the M2R10 dialect of Modula-2 and
any of the language changes.  If you wish to see something different
please email gm2@nongnu.org with your ideas.
