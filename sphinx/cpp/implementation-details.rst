Implementation Details
----------------------

Here we document details of how the preprocessor's implementation
affects its user-visible behavior.  You should try to avoid undue
reliance on behavior described here, as it is possible that it will
change subtly in future implementations.

Also documented here are obsolete features still supported by CPP.
