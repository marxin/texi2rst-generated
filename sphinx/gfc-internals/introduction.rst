Introduction
------------

.. The following duplicates the text on the TexInfo table of contents.

At present, this manual is very much a work in progress, containing 
miscellaneous notes about the internals of the compiler.  It is hoped
that at some point in the future it will become a reasonably complete
guide; in the interim, GNU Fortran developers are strongly encouraged to
contribute to it as a way of keeping notes while working on the 
compiler.
