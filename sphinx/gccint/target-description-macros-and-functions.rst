Target Description Macros and Functions
---------------------------------------

.. index:: machine description macros

.. index:: target description macros

.. index:: macros, target description

.. index:: tm.h macros

In addition to the file :samp:`:samp:`{machine}`.md`, a machine description
includes a C header file conventionally given the name
:samp:`:samp:`{machine}`.h` and a C source file named :samp:`:samp:`{machine}`.c`.
The header file defines numerous macros that convey the information
about the target machine that does not fit into the scheme of the
:samp:`.md` file.  The file :samp:`tm.h` should be a link to
:samp:`:samp:`{machine}`.h`.  The header file :samp:`config.h` includes
:samp:`tm.h` and most compiler source files include :samp:`config.h`.  The
source file defines a variable ``targetm``, which is a structure
containing pointers to functions and data relating to the target
machine.  :samp:`:samp:`{machine}`.c` should also contain their definitions,
if they are not defined elsewhere in GCC, and other functions called
through the macros defined in the :samp:`.h` file.
