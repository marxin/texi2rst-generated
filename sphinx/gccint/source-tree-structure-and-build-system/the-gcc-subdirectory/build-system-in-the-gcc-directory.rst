.. _build:

Build System in the gcc Directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FIXME: describe the build system, including what is built in what
stages.  Also list the various source files that are used in the build
process but aren't source files of GCC itself and so aren't documented
below (see :ref:`passes`).
