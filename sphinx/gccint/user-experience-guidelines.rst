To borrow a slogan from
https://elm-lang.org/news/compilers-as-assistantsElm,

Compilers should be assistants, not adversaries.  A compiler should
not just detect bugs, it should then help you understand why there is a bug.
It should not berate you in a robot voice, it should give you specific hints
that help you write better code. Ultimately, a compiler should make
programming faster and more fun!
Evan Czaplicki

This chapter provides guidelines on how to implement diagnostics and
command-line options in ways that we hope achieve the above ideal.
