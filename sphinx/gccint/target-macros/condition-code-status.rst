Condition Code Status
*********************

Condition codes in GCC are represented as registers,
which provides better schedulability for
architectures that do have a condition code register, but on which
most instructions do not affect it.  The latter category includes
most RISC machines.

Implicit clobbering would pose a strong restriction on the placement of
the definition and use of the condition code.  In the past the definition
and use were always adjacent.  However, recent changes to support trapping
arithmetic may result in the definition and user being in different blocks.
Thus, there may be a ``NOTE_INSN_BASIC_BLOCK`` between them.  Additionally,
the definition may be the source of exception handling edges.

These restrictions can prevent important
optimizations on some machines.  For example, on the IBM RS/6000, there
is a delay for taken branches unless the condition code register is set
three instructions earlier than the conditional branch.  The instruction
scheduler cannot perform this optimization if it is not permitted to
separate the definition and use of the condition code register.

If there is a specific
condition code register in the machine, use a hard register.  If the
condition code or comparison result can be placed in any general register,
or if there are multiple condition registers, use a pseudo register.
Registers used to store the condition code value will usually have a mode
that is in class ``MODE_CC``.

Alternatively, you can use ``BImode`` if the comparison operator is
specified already in the compare instruction.  In this case, you are not
interested in most macros in this section.

.. _mode_cc-condition-codes:

Representation of condition codes using registers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. c:macro:: SELECT_CC_MODE (op, x, y)

  On many machines, the condition code may be produced by other instructions
  than compares, for example the branch can use directly the condition
  code set by a subtract instruction.  However, on some machines
  when the condition code is set this way some bits (such as the overflow
  bit) are not set in the same way as a test instruction, so that a different
  branch instruction must be used for some conditional branches.  When
  this happens, use the machine mode of the condition code register to
  record different formats of the condition code register.  Modes can
  also be used to record which compare instruction (e.g. a signed or an
  unsigned comparison) produced the condition codes.

  If other modes than ``CCmode`` are required, add them to
  :samp:`{machine}-modes.def` and define ``SELECT_CC_MODE`` to choose
  a mode given an operand of a compare.  This is needed because the modes
  have to be chosen not only during RTL generation but also, for example,
  by instruction combination.  The result of ``SELECT_CC_MODE`` should
  be consistent with the mode used in the patterns; for example to support
  the case of the add on the SPARC discussed above, we have the pattern

  .. code-block:: c++

    (define_insn ""
      [(set (reg:CCNZ 0)
            (compare:CCNZ
              (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "%r")
                       (match_operand:SI 1 "arith_operand" "rI"))
              (const_int 0)))]
      ""
      "...")

  together with a ``SELECT_CC_MODE`` that returns ``CCNZmode``
  for comparisons whose argument is a ``plus`` :

  .. code-block:: c++

    #define SELECT_CC_MODE(OP,X,Y) \
      (GET_MODE_CLASS (GET_MODE (X)) == MODE_FLOAT           \
       ? ((OP == LT || OP == LE || OP == GT || OP == GE)     \
          ? CCFPEmode : CCFPmode)                            \
       : ((GET_CODE (X) == PLUS || GET_CODE (X) == MINUS     \
           || GET_CODE (X) == NEG || GET_CODE (x) == ASHIFT) \
          ? CCNZmode : CCmode))

  Another reason to use modes is to retain information on which operands
  were used by the comparison; see ``REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE`` later in
  this section.

  You should define this macro if and only if you define extra CC modes
  in :samp:`{machine}-modes.def`.

.. function:: void TARGET_CANONICALIZE_COMPARISON (int *code, rtx *op0, rtx *op1, bool op0_preserve_value)

  .. hook-start:TARGET_CANONICALIZE_COMPARISON

  On some machines not all possible comparisons are defined, but you can
  convert an invalid comparison into a valid one.  For example, the Alpha
  does not have a ``GT`` comparison, but you can use an ``LT``
  comparison instead and swap the order of the operands.

  On such machines, implement this hook to do any required conversions.
  :samp:`{code}` is the initial comparison code and :samp:`{op0}` and :samp:`{op1}`
  are the left and right operands of the comparison, respectively.  If
  :samp:`{op0_preserve_value}` is ``true`` the implementation is not
  allowed to change the value of :samp:`{op0}` since the value might be used
  in RTXs which aren't comparisons.  E.g. the implementation is not
  allowed to swap operands in that case.

  GCC will not assume that the comparison resulting from this macro is
  valid but will see if the resulting insn matches a pattern in the
  :samp:`md` file.

  You need not to implement this hook if it would never change the
  comparison code or operands.

.. hook-end

.. c:macro:: REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (mode)

  A C expression whose value is one if it is always safe to reverse a
  comparison whose mode is :samp:`{mode}`.  If ``SELECT_CC_MODE``
  can ever return :samp:`{mode}` for a floating-point inequality comparison,
  then ``REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (mode)`` must be zero.

  You need not define this macro if it would always returns zero or if the
  floating-point format is anything other than ``IEEE_FLOAT_FORMAT``.
  For example, here is the definition used on the SPARC, where floating-point
  inequality comparisons are given either ``CCFPEmode`` or ``CCFPmode`` :

  .. code-block:: c++

    #define REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE(MODE) \
       ((MODE) != CCFPEmode && (MODE) != CCFPmode)

.. c:macro:: REVERSE_CONDITION (code, mode)

  A C expression whose value is reversed condition code of the :samp:`{code}` for
  comparison done in CC_MODE :samp:`{mode}`.  The macro is used only in case
  ``REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (mode)`` is nonzero.  Define this macro in case
  machine has some non-standard way how to reverse certain conditionals.  For
  instance in case all floating point conditions are non-trapping, compiler may
  freely convert unordered compares to ordered ones.  Then definition may look
  like:

  .. code-block:: c++

    #define REVERSE_CONDITION(CODE, MODE) \
       ((MODE) != CCFPmode ? reverse_condition (CODE) \
        : reverse_condition_maybe_unordered (CODE))

.. function:: bool TARGET_FIXED_CONDITION_CODE_REGS (unsigned int *p1, unsigned int *p2)

  .. hook-start:TARGET_FIXED_CONDITION_CODE_REGS

  On targets which use a hard
  register rather than a pseudo-register to hold condition codes, the
  regular CSE passes are often not able to identify cases in which the
  hard register is set to a common value.  Use this hook to enable a
  small pass which optimizes such cases.  This hook should return true
  to enable this pass, and it should set the integers to which its
  arguments point to the hard register numbers used for condition codes.
  When there is only one such register, as is true on most systems, the
  integer pointed to by :samp:`{p2}` should be set to
  ``INVALID_REGNUM``.

  The default version of this hook returns false.

.. hook-end

.. function:: machine_mode TARGET_CC_MODES_COMPATIBLE (machine_mode m1, machine_mode m2)

  .. hook-start:TARGET_CC_MODES_COMPATIBLE

  On targets which use multiple condition code modes in class
  ``MODE_CC``, it is sometimes the case that a comparison can be
  validly done in more than one mode.  On such a system, define this
  target hook to take two mode arguments and to return a mode in which
  both comparisons may be validly done.  If there is no such mode,
  return ``VOIDmode``.

  The default version of this hook checks whether the modes are the
  same.  If they are, it returns that mode.  If they are different, it
  returns ``VOIDmode``.

.. hook-end

.. c:var:: unsigned int TARGET_FLAGS_REGNUM

  .. hook-start:TARGET_FLAGS_REGNUM

  If the target has a dedicated flags register, and it needs to use the
  post-reload comparison elimination pass, or the delay slot filler pass,
  then this value should be set appropriately.

.. hook-end
